Ever been bored at work but all the fun websites are blocked? Play Tetris in the Terminal!
All you need is a C compiler and a terminal. The current version is made for the windows terminal.

`fancytetris.c` uses more complicated commands to hide the terminal cursor giving a cleaner look
`tetris.c` uses a simple clear terminal command that has some jittery behaviour but is more portable
